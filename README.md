# myCelestronGuider
Own Guider for Celestron Mounts

Here you will find source code written in python. The goal is to build an own guider but more for learing purposes and less to be the most sophisticated program. We will use
1.) Visual Studio Code with Python
2.) ASCOM via COM interface and ALPACA via http interface
3.) Celestron mount
4.) Omegon camera, Smartphoe or DSLR
